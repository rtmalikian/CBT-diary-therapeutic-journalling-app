- **Evidence-Based Breathing Exercises**: Multiple research-backed breathing patterns including 4-7-8 technique, Box Breathing, Coherent Breathing (6s in, 6s out), Physiological Sigh, and Alternate Nostril Breathing with guided visuals

## Evidence-Based Breathing Patterns

The CBT Diary incorporates scientifically researched breathing techniques proven to reduce anxiety, improve focus, and promote emotional regulation:

### 1. 4-7-8 Breathing (Dr. Andrew Weil)
- Inhale for 4 seconds, hold for 7 seconds, exhale for 8 seconds
- Activates the parasympathetic nervous system
- Particularly effective for reducing anxiety and promoting sleep

### 2. Box Breathing (Military/First Responders)
- Equal count for inhale, hold, exhale, and hold phases (4s each)
- Improves focus, concentration, and stress management
- Used by Navy SEALs and other high-stress professions

### 3. Coherent Breathing (Resonance Frequency Breathing)
- Slow rhythmic breathing at 5 breaths per minute (6s inhale, 6s exhale)
- Optimizes heart rate variability (HRV)
- Improves autonomic nervous system balance

### 4. Physiological Sigh
- Double inhale (1s + 1s) followed by extended exhale (6s)
- Rapidly resets CO2 levels in the body
- Quickly activates parasympathetic response to reduce acute stress

### 5. Alternate Nostril Breathing (Nadi Shodhana)
- Inhale through one nostril, exhale through the other
- Balances left and right brain hemispheres
- Enhances cognitive function and mental clarity

Each technique comes with visual guidance to help maintain proper timing and rhythm for maximum therapeutic benefit.
- **Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR)**: Step-by-step relaxation sessions
- **Write Then Burn**: Securely write sensitive thoughts that self-destruct with animation
- **Mood Tracking**: Track and visualize your emotional patterns over time
